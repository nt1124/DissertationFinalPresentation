\begin{frame}{Project Overview}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Secure Multiparty Computation is a long standing problem in cryptography.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How can mutually distrusting parties collaborate compute a function without revealing their inputs?
		\end{itemize}
		\item A subset of this problem is Secure Two Party Computation (S2C).
		\item Yao Garbled Circuits are one approach to S2C, but naive Yao Circuits only provide security against passive adversaries. 
		\item Recently many protocols have been proposed to use Yao Circuits to provide security in the presence of active adversaries. 
		\item Our aim was to implement some of these recent protocols so we could compare their performance.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Secure Multiparty Computation}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Given $n$ parties who each have an input $x_i$
		\item Parties wish to compute a function $(y_1, ..., y_n) = f(x_1, ..., x_n)$
		\item But they want the following security properties,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Privacy - Participating parties only learn their output.
			\item Correctness - Output is correct evaluation of the function \emph{given the inputs}.
			\item Independence of inputs - Participating parties only learn their output.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Yao's Protocol}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Proposed by Andrew Yao in 1986. Whilst it's primarily for Two Party computation it can be extended to Multiparty computation.
		\item  The basic idea,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item One party is labelled the `Builder' and the other is the `Executor'.
			\item The Builder constructs a binary circuit representing the function.
			\item The Builder then `garbles' this circuit, encrypting it in such a way that it can be evaluated without revealing information about the inputs, and sends it to the Executor.
			\item The Builder's inputs are hardcoded, the Executor's inputs are obtained by Oblivious Transfers.
			\item Using these inputs the Executor can then evaluate the circuit and so the function.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{block}{Oblivious Transfer}
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		\begin{figure}[!htb]
			\centering
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
				\centering
			\textbf{Receiver}\\
				Inputs : $b \in \{0, 1\}$\\
				Outputs : $x_b$\\
			\end{minipage}
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
				\centering
				\textbf{Sender}\\
				Inputs : $x_0, x_1 \in \{0, 1\}^l$\\
				Outputs : $\emptyset$\\
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}

		Formal definition of the functionality of a one-out-of-two OT protocol. The Receiver should learn nothing about the value of $x_{1-b}$ and the Sender should learn nothing about $b$.
	\end{block}

	We will not dwell on the details of Oblivious Transfer, suffice to say it is possible, if anyone is interested in seeing a concrete protocol I suggest the Naor-Pinkas Oblivious Transfer.

\begin{frame}{The Security of Yao's Protocol}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item As already mentioned Yao Circuits are only secure in the presence of passive adversaries. \footnotemark
		\item In naive Yao Circuits the Executor has no way to know if the circuit given to it by the Builder actually computes the function it purports to.
		\item There are two main approaches to overcoming this,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cut and Choose.
			\item Commit and Prove.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\footnotetext[1]{For a formal proof of this see ``A Proof of Security of Yao's Protocol for Two-Party Computation'' by Lindell and Pinkas (2006) }
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Cut and Choose - Concept}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item All three protocols we implemented are based on Cut and Choose.
		\item The Builder now generates many garbled circuits and sends them to the Executor.
		\item The Executor then picks a set of these circuits and asks the Builder to open them so they can be checked for correctness.
		\item If all check circuits pass then the rest of the circuits are evaluated.
		\item So a malicious Builder must now guess which circuits will be checked.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Cut and Choose - Issues}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Cut and Choose seems trivially simple, however it actually raises several new problems.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
