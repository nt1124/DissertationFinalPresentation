Slide 02 = Project Background
- 


Slide 03 = Project Motivation
- Mention theoreticals can only take us so far.


Slide 04 = Yao's Protocol
- Very brief overview.
- Builder and Executor, Builder makes garbled circuit. Sends to Executor.
- Only secure if the Builder is generating circuits honestly. Executor cannot check.


Slide 05 = Cut and Choose - Concept
- So how can we achieve security without putting any trust in the Builder?
- Cut and Choose, basic idea is the Builder makes many circuits.
- Executor chooses some to be opened and checked for correctness.


Slide 06 = Cut and Choose - Pitfall
- Very simple conceptually but there are some nuances.
- Coming from there being many circuits.
- Consistency of Inputs : Making sure the parties give the same input to each circuit.
- Output determination : What if different circuits give different results.
